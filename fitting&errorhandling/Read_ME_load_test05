here i have used the trained model to detect the frames of goalpost and then save them to to defrent folders of possitive and negetive.
for erroe handling,,
i hve removed the frames by considering the collectiveness and consecutiveness 
and then ploted time stams of positive images vs their frame number and the same plot after error handling
